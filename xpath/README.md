## What is XPath

XPath also called as XML Path is a language to query XML documents.
It is an important strategy to locate elements in selenium.
It consists of a path expression along with some conditions.
Here, you can easily write XPath script/query to locate any element in the webpage.
It is designed to allow the navigation of XML documents,
with the purpose of selecting individual elements, attributes,
or some other part of an XML document for specific processing.
It also produces reliable locators.

Now, let's understand how to write an XPath for an XML Document.

## XML Document
