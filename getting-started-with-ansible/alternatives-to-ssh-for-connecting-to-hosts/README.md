# Alternatives to SSH for Connecting to Hosts

## [Ansible Glossary](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html)

- Push Mode
  Push mode is the default mode of Ansible.
  In fact, it's not really a mode at all â€“
  it's just how Ansible works when you aren't thinking about it.
  Push mode allows Ansible to be fine-grained
  and conduct nodes through complex orchestration processes without waiting for them to check in.
- Pull Mode
  By default, Ansible runs in push mode,
  which allows it very fine-grained control over when it talks to each system.
  Pull mode is provided for
  when you would rather have nodes check in every N minutes on a particular schedule.
  It uses a program called `ansible-pull`
  and can also be set up (or reconfigured) using a `push-mode` playbook.
  Most Ansible users use push mode,
  but pull mode is included for variety and the sake of having choices.
  `ansible-pull` works by checking configuration orders out of git on a crontab
  and then managing the machine locally,
  using the local connection plugin.
