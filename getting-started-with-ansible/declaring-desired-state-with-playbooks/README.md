# Declaring Desired State with Playbooks

![Anchoring Analogy](assets/anchoring-analogy.png)

## [Ansible Glossary](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html)

### Playbooks

> **Playbooks** are the language by which
> Ansible **orchestrates**, **configures**, **administers**, or **deploys** systems.

### Plays

> A playbook is a list of **plays**.
> <br />A **play** is minimally a mapping between
> a set of hosts selected by a host specifier
> (usually chosen by groups but sometimes by hostname globs)
> and the tasks which run on those hosts
> to define the role that those systems will perform.
> <br />There can be one, or many **plays** in a playbook.

### Host

> A **host** is simply a remote machine that Ansible manages.
> <br />They can have individual variables assigned to them,
> and can also be organized in groups.
> <br />All hosts have a name they can be reached at
> (which is either an IP address, or a domain name)
> and, optionally, a port number,
> if they are not to be accessed on the default SSH port.

### Task and Action

> Playbooks exist to run **Tasks**.

![Task vs. Action](assets/task-vs-action.png)

- You can execute a single task once with an ad-hoc command.
- Each task can have only one action, but it may have many parameters.

### Handlers

> Handlers are a special kind of task
> that only run if the Task contains a `notify` directive
> and also indicates that it changed something.
> For example, if a config file is changed,
> then the task referencing the config file templating operation may notify a service restart handler.
> This means services can be bounced only if they need to be restarted.
> Handlers can be used for things other than service restarts,
> but service restarts are the most common usage.

### Modules

> Modules are the units of work that Ansible ships out to remote machines.
> Modules are kicked off by either `/usr/local/bin/ansible` or `/usr/local/bin/ansible-playbook`
> (where multiple tasks use lots of different modules in conjunction).
> Modules can be implemented in any language, including Perl, Bash, or Ruby â€“
> but can leverage some useful communal library code if written in Python.
> Modules just have to return JSON.
> Once modules are executed on remote machines,
> they are removed, so no long-running daemons are used.
> Ansible refers to the collection of available modules as a library.

The units of code Ansible executes.
Each module has a particular use,
from administering users on a specific type of database
to managing VLAN interfaces on a specific type of network device.
You can invoke a single module with a task, or invoke several different modules in a playbook.
For an idea of how many modules Ansible includes,
take a look at the list of all modules.

These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system.

Your library of modules can reside on any machine,
and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required.
