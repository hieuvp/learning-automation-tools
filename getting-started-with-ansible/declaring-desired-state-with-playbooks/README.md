# Declaring Desired State with Playbooks

## [Ansible Glossary](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html)

### Playbooks

> **Playbooks** are the language by which
> Ansible **orchestrates**, **configures**, **administers**, or **deploys** systems.

### Host

> A host is simply a remote machine that Ansible manages.
> They can have individual variables assigned to them,
> and can also be organized in groups.
> All hosts have a name they can be reached at (which is either an IP address or a domain name) and,
> optionally, a port number, if they are not to be accessed on the default SSH port.

### Task

> Playbooks exist to run tasks.
> Tasks combine an action (a module and its arguments) with a name
> and optionally some other keywords (like looping directives).
> Handlers are also tasks, but they are a special kind of task
> that do not run unless they are notified by name
> when a task reports an underlying change on a remote system.

### Modules

> Modules are the units of work that Ansible ships out to remote machines.
> Modules are kicked off by either `/usr/bin/ansible` or `/usr/bin/ansible-playbook`
> (where multiple tasks use lots of different modules in conjunction).
> Modules can be implemented in any language, including Perl, Bash, or Ruby â€“
> but can leverage some useful communal library code if written in Python.
> Modules just have to return JSON.
> Once modules are executed on remote machines,
> they are removed, so no long-running daemons are used.
> Ansible refers to the collection of available modules as a library.

```yml
