# ini format for configuring access to localhost as a target 
localhost ansible_connection="local" ansible_python_interpreter="/usr/local/bin/python3"

# Notes (several challenges implicit below)
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#ansible-python-interpreter 
  # ansible_python_interpreter is one of:
    # - path (to desired remote python interpreter)
    # - automatic discovery mode (auto, auto_silent, auto_legacy, ... )
  # see `ansible-config list` & look for ansible_python_interpreter for more
  # also see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more about interpreter discovery
  # - setting path is useful when you have a target with multiple python installs or nonstandard locations for installs, to avoid ambiguity and then ansible doesn't have to sniff out the python interpreter.
  # - challenge: run `ansible -m ping HOSTNAME` to see discovered interpreter path and if that isn't what is desired then set what is desired!
